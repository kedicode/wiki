=July 15th=

Actually slept well and got to spend some quality time with Lindsay last night. Yeah you know what that means. I got that pussy and it was amazing. I think I will have some more tonight. Also I am going to beat it doggie style a little bit. 

Lindsay liked that I was doing the todo list again and recommended that I post it on the board. I told her that I was doing it in the vimwiki as diary entries so that I could keep track of it effectively.
