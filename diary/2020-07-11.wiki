Had a really good talk with Lindsay today about how I was feeling. Felt like we were able to make some headway and understand each other better. I shared with here some of my diary entries. 

Dabby had a situation where she ran after a golfcart today. The man kept driving and I was running after him saying "stop so I can get my dog lol" He did not stop for quite some time.
