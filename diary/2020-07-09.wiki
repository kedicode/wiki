Hello world. Happy Thursday
Math went a bit better today. I noticed that when I slowed down and made sure to match my pairs for linear graphing things worked better. 
A good win today though was that I was able to configure correctly the xpdf application to hid toolbars and use vi keybindings. That is nice.
Lindsay and I seem to be drifting. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. I really love this girl but sometimes don't know what to do. I hope that it can be fixed and I will try.
