Today working on Math was a bit of a challenge. I think that I need to make sure I spread my meals out in a way that makes sense to be able to have the energy. I also need to really start using a todo again. 

Lindsay said that I could have some pussy tonight and I am really looking forward to pleasing her tonight. I am really excited about that.

I also wanted to add that since I got the Pop Os operating system setup and it is not terrible with my 4 year old i3 processor. I Am going to stick with this particular build and possible order an ssd and some memory as it is pretty cheap right now. I should be able to get at least another year or so out of the machine after making that quick change to the system.
Cheers.
