This is my first diary entry for the vimwiki diary feature. I wonder how well I will use this and what stuff I will put in there
I feel that math was particulary hard today. I had some problems with the point slope form of y-b = m(x-a). It wasn't that I was
not understanding the problem but I seems to be missing small steps in the calculation. I will slow down and see if that helps.

This evening I noticed that I had a bit of difficulty with getting into the groove with some of my python problems. 
I think I need to slow down and start writing stuff out my hand or maybe using some pseudocode code in the future to help with this.
It wasn't that the material was hard by any means just I was initially using a wrong problem solving method and wasted time on a wrong
algorithm. At least I can improve right.
